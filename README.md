# CS340_Client-Server_Development
Culmination of work and study for SNHU's CS-340 Class.


## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
When working on the CRUD Python module for Project One, I emphasized creating maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. The structure was designed with proper functions and documentation to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. The advantages of working in this manner include enhanced collaboration, ease of updating the code, and the possibility of reusing the code for similar purposes in the future. By following coding standards and best practices, the CRUD module can be leveraged across different projects, enhancing adaptability.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare required a systematic and analytical perspective. I began by understanding the client's specific needs, breaking down the requirements into smaller tasks, and developing a design that could accommodate future changes. Unlike previous assignments, this project required a direct alignment with a real-world scenario, making it essential to think from a business perspective. The techniques and strategies employed here can be replicated in future projects to create databases or systems that meet different client needs.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems using technology, algorithms, and computational thinking. They bridge the gap between technological possibilities and practical business needs. In the case of the dashboard project for Grazioso Salvare, the work helped the company by providing them with a tool that organizes and analyzes data efficiently. By developing customized solutions, the work supports the company in making informed decisions and improving their operational efficiency. This type of project illustrates the tangible impact that computer scientists can have on an organization, highlighting the importance and relevance of the field.
